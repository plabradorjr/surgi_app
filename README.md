# SurgiApp v0.0.1

## What is it?

SurgiApp is a simple content management system. At its' minimum viable product phase, it is designed to keep track of instruments and it's exact location.

# Purpose

## Problem Overview

This app is not for everyone, it is built for new operating room nurses (orientees and travelers) working at my current job. We have millions worth of supplies and equipments stored in four different rooms and two different floor levels. Each of these storage rooms are different in layouts and it becomes very easy to get lost for newer hires. Every equipments' supply count are tracked. However, there are no documentations to where these items could be located. 

Every single day, there will be a staff member who will ask about where to find something while an operation currently in progress. Every 3-6 months there will be new grad nurse plus new travel nurses. And every few months, people will quit or leave for various reasons. We will always have newly hired staffs that can benefit from a search tool and database to quickly locate a specific item in need.

## Goal

The goal is so we can help each nurses grow, regardless of experience level. The more we contribute and organize our information, the better off we'll be. By building this simple inventory and search app, we can leverage on each others' collective wisdom. More data is not always better, what we are really looking for is forward-motion. I believe that if we adopt this site as a tool for information, we would be significantly better off than we were before.

## Design overview

The app is deliberately designed so that collaboration is key to its usefulness. Without other peoples' contributions, this app leads nowhere, and information will remain outdated. 

# Installation

Next, run `rake db:migrate` to create database.
