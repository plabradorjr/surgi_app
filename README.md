# üè© SurgiApp v0.0.1

## What is it?

SurgiApp is an open-content collaborative database. A simple content management system. This Minimum Viable Product is designed to keep track of instruments and its' exact location.

# Purpose

## Problem Overview

This app is not for everyone, it is built for new operating room nurses and surgical techs (orientees and travelers) working at my current job. Within our Operating Room department, there are millions worth of supplies and equipments stored in multiple different rooms and different floor levels. None of the rooms are exactly identical in layouts. For new staff members, it becomes very easy to get lost trying to find equipments. There are no documentations to where the supplies are located. 

Every single day, there will be a staff member who will ask about where to find something while an operation is currently in progress. Every 3-6 months there will be newly hired nurses and techs. And every few months, people will leave for various reasons. We will always have people that can benefit from a search engine and database to effectively locate a specific item.

## Goal

The goal is so we can help each nurses and tech grow, regardless of experience level. The more we contribute and organize our information, the better off we'll be. By building this simple collaborative inventory and search app, we can leverage on each others' collective wisdom. More data is not always better, what we are really looking for is forward-motion. I believe that if we adopt this app (or any other better app) as a tool for information, we would be significantly better off than we were before.

## Design overview

SurgiApp is deliberately designed so that collaboration is key to its usefulness. Anyone can edit any entries. Without other peoples' contributions, this app leads nowhere, and information will remain outdated. 

# Installation

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies.

Next, run `rake db:migrate` to create database.

Finally, to view app on your local host, run `shotgun` and head to the specified port.
